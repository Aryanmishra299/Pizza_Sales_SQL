🚀 SQL Data Analysis on Pizza Sales! 🍕📊

I'm excited to share my recent SQL project, where I analyzed pizza sales data to extract valuable insights using basic, intermediate, and advanced SQL queries. This project helped me strengthen my database querying skills and gain a deeper understanding of business analytics in the food industry.

Key Highlights of the Project:
✅ Retrieved total orders placed and calculated total revenue 💰
✅ Identified the highest-priced pizza and the most common pizza size 🔍
✅ Analyzed order distribution by time and category-wise pizza sales 📈
✅ Determined the top-performing pizzas based on revenue and order frequency 🏆
✅ Calculated cumulative revenue trends and category-wise contribution to total sales

This project challenged me to write efficient SQL queries, use joins, aggregations, window functions, and ranking techniques to derive meaningful insights. 💡

I also created a PowerPoint presentation showcasing the queries, findings, and business takeaways! 🖥️📑
